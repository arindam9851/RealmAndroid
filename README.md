Realm database

Realm Java enables you to efficiently write your app’s model layer in a safe, persisted and fast way.

Realm is a replacement for SQLite & Core Data

Easy to Use

Realm is not an ORM on top of SQLite. Instead it uses its own persistence engine, built for simplicity (& speed).

Fast

Thanks to its zero-copy design, Realm is much faster than an ORM, and is often faster than raw SQLite as well.

Cross-Platform
You can share Realm files across platforms and use the same high-level models.

See graphic performance comparison to other databases here.

Prerequisites

Realm do not support Java outside of Android at the moment.
Android Studio >= 0.8.6
A recent version of the Android SDK.
JDK version >=7.
Support all Android versions since API Level 9 (Android 2.3 Gingerbread & above).
Here how it looks like

public class User extends RealmObject {
	@PrimaryKey
    private long id;
    private String firstName;
	//basic implementation
}
//write single User object
 realm.executeTransaction(new Realm.Transaction() {
            @Override
            public void execute(Realm bgRealm) {
                bgRealm.copyToRealmOrUpdate(user);
            }
        });
//Query to look for all users
realm.where(User.class).findAll();
Installation

Make sure your project uses jcenter as a dependency repository (default on latest version of the Android Gradle plugin).

Add plug in in your project. See latest version on realm.io

In the Android Studio menu: Tools->Android->Sync Project with Gradle Files.

Best Practices

UI or not UI?

Typically Realm is fast enough to read and write data on Android’s main thread. However, write transactions are blocking across threads so in order to prevent accidental Application Not Responding Errors (ANR’s) there are advise to perform all Realm write operations on a background thread (not Android’s main thread).
RealmResults<User> userList = realm.where(User.class).findAllAsync();
userList.addChangeListener(new RealmChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onChange() {
                //userList is now filled with data
                //update UI here
            }
        });
  realm.executeTransaction(new Realm.Transaction() {
            @Override
            public void execute(Realm bgRealm) {
                bgRealm.copyToRealmOrUpdate(user);
            }
        });
However while you working with a small amount of data, don't be afraid to write/load data on UI thread. See according Christian Melchior answer on StackOverflow.
Controlling the lifecycle of Realm instances

To avoid the overhead of opening and closing the Realm data connection, Realm has a reference counted cache internally. This implies that calling Realm.getDefaultInstance() multiple times on the same thread is free, and the underlying resources will automatically be released when all instances are closed.

This means that on the UI thread the easiest and safest approach is to open a Realm instance in all your Activities and Fragments and close it again when the Activity or Fragment is destroyed.

public class RealmApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        RealmConfiguration realmConfiguration = new RealmConfiguration
        .Builder(this).build();
        Realm.setDefaultConfiguration(realmConfiguration);
    }
}
public class RealmActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    protected Realm mRealm;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        mRealm = Realm.getDefaultInstance();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        if (mRealm != null) {
            mRealm.close();
        }
    }
}
Reuse RealmResults and RealmObjects

On the UI thread and all other Looper threads, all RealmObjects and RealmResults are automatically refreshed when changes are made to the Realm. This means that it isn’t necessary to fetch those objects again when reacting to a RealmChangedListener. The objects are already updated and ready to be redrawn on the screen.
Keep in mind while using Realm (Limitations)

RealmObject can have:

Only private instance fields.
Only default getter and setter methods.
Static fields, both public and private.
Static methods.
Implementing interfaces with no methods.
You can only save objects that extend RealmObject inside a Realm. That means that you have to declare an RealmList if you want to save a List, or extend RealmObject while saving an object.

See StackOverflow answer for data saving.
